"""
The indexes coming out in the last line represent the inferred box assignments for View B, indicating which box from View A corresponds to each box in View B. 

Here's a breakdown of how to interpret these indexes:

1. `estimated_assignments_b`: This tensor contains the model's output for the box assignments for View B. Each row of this tensor corresponds to a box in View B, and the values in each row indicate the model's confidence or assignment score for that box in View B.

2. `.argmax(dim=1)`: The `.argmax(dim=1)` function is used to find the index (position) of the maximum value along each row of `estimated_assignments_b`. In other words, for each box in View B, this operation identifies which box in View A has the highest assigned confidence score. 

   - For example, if `estimated_assignments_b.argmax(dim=1)` returns `[2, 0, 1, 3, 4]`, it means that:
     - Box B1 corresponds to Box A2
     - Box B2 corresponds to Box A0
     - Box B3 corresponds to Box A1
     - Box B4 corresponds to Box A3
     - Box B5 corresponds to Box A4

These indexes essentially provide a mapping or assignment of boxes from View B to their corresponding boxes in View A, based on the model's output. Each index tells you which box in View A is the most likely match for a given box in View B according to the model's learned assignments.
